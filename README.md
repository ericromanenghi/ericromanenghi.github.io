# My personal website

I am still trying to figure it out, but the main idea it's to use it for my writings (poetry, short stories, maybe some essays).

The website it's running on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Initially I plan to support only Spanish, but supporting an English version is definitely in the TODO list.
