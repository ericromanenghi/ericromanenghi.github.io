# My personal website

I am still trying to figure it out, but the main idea it's to use it for my writings (poetry, short stories, maybe some essays).

The website it's running on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Initially I plan to support only Spanish, but supporting an English version is definitely in the TODO list. Actually, let's create a TODO list!

TODO:
* Create the main page
   * ~~Menu bar which includes the different categories~~
   * ~~Footer with license~~
   * ~~Short explanation about this website~~
   * ~~Short explanation about the different categories in the website (it will keep expanding while adding new content, I can start just with poems and short stories)~~
   * ~~Short "about me" section~~
* ~~License content as creative commons~~
* ~~Add pages for categories~~
* Add Google Analytics support
* Start adding content!
* Add support for English, translate at least the main page (translate content itself will be way harder but I still have some hopes I will eventually do it)
* Make website responsive
   * ~~Main issue seems to be the header~~
